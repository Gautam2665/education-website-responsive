            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                prabhu.[28] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and Shishya was
                very important part of the education.[29] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of
                ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable
                whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not
                have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed
                purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda
                university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the
                modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -PÃ¡li language.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Focussing on the experiences and perceptions of parents and volunteer
                caregivers of children with disabilities, this paper reports on a study that explored the provision of
                early childhood development and inclusive education for children with disabilities in rural Malawi.
                Drawing on a community-based participatory research (CBPR) design, ten local community researchers and
                two Malawian researchers collaborated to interview forty caregivers and parents of children with
                disabilities attending ten Community Based Care Centres (CBCCS) in Southern Malawi. Findings are
                reported through four key themes: experiences of disability, inclusion, learning and developmental
                progress; factors influencing non-enrolment and absenteeism; barriers to learning and progress; and
                accountability and support channels.</p>
